      <p>/* It is possible to use position:absolute to center an element on a webpage . Then, add top: 50% and left: 50%. It would just centralize the element, but the position would be a bit off since it would centralize the left and top part of the element and not the middle of it. In this way, it is needed to use transform: translate(-50%, -50%). It will disconsider 50% on the top and left of the element which would make the element be aligned */</p>
